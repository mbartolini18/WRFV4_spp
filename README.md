### WRF-ARW Code ###
*Version of WRFv4.2.2 code base, edited by Massey Bartolini, with additions to SPP routines including novel perturbations applied to microphysics.*

| Branch | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| spp_mp_gt+mb_prates_hdf_gwd_hrrre | HRRR Ensemble (HRRRE)-like code used for simulations presented in the submitted journal article, with new modifications to SPP code applied to the TE14 microphysics scheme (Thompson et al. 2021). |
| spp_mp_gt_prates_hdf_gwd_hrrre | Code base with existing SPP physics, with SPP-MP routines already published and described in Thompson et al. (2021). |
| master | Original WRF code base, unmodified. |
