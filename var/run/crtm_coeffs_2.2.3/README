and will be put in WRFDA website for download from the release 4.0. A copy of the whole folder is also made
available under /glade/p/work/wrfhelp/WRFDA_files/crtm_coeffs_2.2.3 on the NCAR Cheyenne supercomputer 
(for internal use). The full set of CRTM coefficient files can also be downloaded from the official CRTM
